`Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)`
    *Overview*
    *The JavaScript function "grading()" is designed to calculate the grade of a student based on the marks attained by the student.*
    
    1.The function "grading()" for calculating a student's grade is declared using the "Function" keyword

    2.When the code is runned, the user is prompted to input the marks of a student for grading.

    3.The function "Number()" converts the input to a numeric value before  the calculations.

    4.The function "isNaN" check if the input is a number. If the input is not a number ,it tells the user to enter a number else it procceds.

    5.The input is then checked if it is from 0 to 100. It is not in the range it tells the user to enter a valid marks.

    6.The function uses multiple "if" statements to compare the marks to different ranges and return the corresponding grade string using the following criteria:
        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

    7.The final "else" statement handles any remaining cases and returns "Grade is E".

    8.The function then outputs the Grade based on the marks entered.


`Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)`
    *Overview*
    *The JavaScript function "calculateDemerits()" is designed to calculate demerit points based on the speed of a vehicle exceeding a specified speed limit. It also checks if the accumulated demerit points lead to the suspension of the driver's license.*

    1.The function "calculateDemerits()" for calculating the demerits points of a driver is declared using the "Function" keyword

    2.The constant speed limit and maximum demerit points are set.

    3.The function "isNaN" check if the input is a number. If the input is not a number ,it tells the user to enter a number else, it procceds.

    4. If the speed entered is less then or equal to the speed limit, the driver is okay.

    5.Incase the speed is greater than the speed limit, the demerit points are calculated.

    7.The demerit points are compared to the maximum demerit points an if they exceed the maximum demerit points, it outputs that the driver's licence is suspended.
